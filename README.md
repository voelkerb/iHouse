# iHouse - A voice controlled, centralized, retrospective Smart Home System

Speech recognition in smart home systems has become popular in both, research and consumer areas. Therefore, this solution is based on an innovative concept for a modular, customizable, and voice-controlled smart home system. The system combines the advantages of distributed and centralized processing to enable a secure as well as highly modular platform and allows to add existing non-smart components retrospectively into the smart environment. To interact with the system in the most comfortable way - and in particular without additional devices like smartphones - voice-controlling was added as the means of choice. The task of speech recognition is partitioned into decentral Wake-Up-Word (WUW) recognition and central continuous speech recognition to enable flexibility while maintaining security. This is achieved utilizing a novel WUW algorithm suitable to be executed on small microcontrollers which uses Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as well as Dynamic Time Warping.



# Why is not every home smart (yet)?
This has - at least in my opinion - 4 major reasons:
1. Missing compatibility between existing products <img src="https://github.com/voelkerb/iHouse/blob/master/docu/Compatibility.jpg" width="100">
2. Security <img src="https://github.com/voelkerb/iHouse/blob/master/docu/Security.jpg" width="100">
3. Retrospective use and affordability <img src="https://github.com/voelkerb/iHouse/blob/master/docu/Retrospectivity.jpg" width="100">
4. Flexibility and ease of use <img src="https://github.com/voelkerb/iHouse/blob/master/docu/Flexibility.jpg" width="100">
